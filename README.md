# CEC Undergraduate Research Celebration

<h2>Research Question</h2>
Can a Low Cost EDR Solution be Developed Utilizing Azure Cloud and Open Source Tools?
<br />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
Cyber threats have evolved rapidly with increased modern tool capabililties. Machine Learning and AI are new technologies that have accelerated the offensive capabilities of potential hackers. New technology exposes businesses to new threats. The proposed product uses AI and ML technologies to provide high value defensive capabilities.
<br />

<h2>Goal</h2>
Our goal was to develop a Cloud tool to mitigate evolving threats in a cost-effective way. nowadays, a significant problem for companies is the increasing costs for cyber security tools resulting in financial barriers of entry to protect networks. Consequently, small businesses are at a higher risk of attacks creating more losses online. To solve this problem, we developed a robust and visually engaging dashboard with relatively low costs for upkeep and deployment for small businesses to grow securely.

<h2>ML Verification</h2>
Using the ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix, users will be able to verify the accuracy of the ML models' predictions and respond in an effective way.
