# CEC Undergraduate Research Celebration

<h2>Research Question</h2>
How can a low-cost Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution be effectively developed by leveraging Azure Cloud services and Open Source Tools?
<br />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

The landscape of cyber threats has undergone rapid evolution, propelled by the enhanced capabilities of modern tools. The advent of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has notably accelerated the offensive potential of prospective attackers. Consequently, businesses find themselves exposed to novel threats stemming from these advancements in technology.

In response to this evolving threat landscape, our proposed product harnesses the power of AI and ML technologies to deliver sophisticated defensive capabilities, thereby offering high-value protection to organizations.
<br />

<h2>Goal</h2>

Our objective was to create a Cloud tool designed to effectively mitigate emerging threats in a cost-efficient manner. In the contemporary business landscape, a substantial challenge faced by companies is the escalating costs associated with cybersecurity tools, imposing financial barriers that hinder entry into network protection measures. As a consequence, smaller businesses become particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks, incurring greater online losses.

In addressing this challenge, we have developed a resilient and visually compelling dashboard. This solution is characterized by its relatively low costs for both deployment and maintenance, presenting an accessible avenue for small businesses to foster secure growth.
<br />

<h2>ML Verification</h2>

By employing the ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix, users gain the capability to validate the accuracy of predictions made by our Machine Learning (ML) models, enabling them to respond in a highly effective manner. These analytical tools serve as integral components, offering a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance and aiding users in making informed decisions based on the model's predictive capabilities. <br />
